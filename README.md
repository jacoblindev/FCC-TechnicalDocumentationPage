# FCC-TechnicalDocumentationPage

FreeCodeCamp RWD projects - Build a Technical Documentation Page (only using HTML & CSS)

I use this opportunity to create a documentation page for my initial solutions of freeCodeCamp's "JS Algorithms And Data Structures Projects". And I implemented the [Prism](https://prismjs.com/) syntax highlighter for the code block, so the code is clear to read.

## Tools
